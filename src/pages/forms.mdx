# Forms & inputs

## Example

The form component is designed to be as simple as possible. You can either pass an Input component or element (which must have a name prop). 
When the form is submited the data is convereted to an object that can be passed to an api, or used in another fashion. Another way is to 
pass an array with the inputs prop to create the form dynamically.

You can see the example out put of this form in the console

<Form onSubmit={(data) => console.log(data)}>
    <Input name="first_name" label="First Name" required/>
    <Input name="last_name" label="Last Name" required />
</Form>
