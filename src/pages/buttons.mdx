import Button from "../components/generics/button"

## Buttons

The button component has 3 versions standard, link & submit.
To get the right version you need to pass a "type" prop stating which one you need. 
This is to ahear to semantics, even though a "link" button looks like a button it needs to be an
a tag. By default you get the regular button, and if you want to use this to submit a form, 
you can passa type of submit.

### standard

<Button>Regular</Button>
<Button type="link" href="#clicked">Link Button</Button>
<Button className="confirm">Confirm</Button>
<Button className="cancel">Cancel</Button>

### state

<Button loading={true}>Send</Button>
<Button loading="done">Send</Button>
<Button disabled>Send</Button>
